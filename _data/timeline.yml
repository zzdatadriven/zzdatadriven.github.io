  description: "As part of the partisan segregation project, I match voter file lists with election 
                data as part of a larger project that measures and maps 
                segregation between partisans at any level of geography in the United States.

                and other big data skills in R."

- title: Course Assistant, GOV 50 Data

  to: present
  description: "GOV 50: Data teaches students introductory data science skills using R tidyverse. 
                The course culminates in a large final project where students create Shiny apps to 
                display their own analysis of a large dataset that they sourced and cleaned. As a 
                Mindich Course Fellow in Fall 2020, I connected students with policymakers, nonprofits, 
                or other stakeholders to maximize the impact of their work. In addition to my unique 
                roles for the fellowship program, I also provided assistance in lectures and held 
                regular office hours."
                
- title: Summer Analyst, Vista Equity Partners

  to: August 2020
  description: "In this role, I spent a large portion of my time preparing research and 
                materials for the senior investor relations and management team members for strategic 
                initiatives. On top of that, I prepared investor profiles, agendas, and any additional 
                research and briefing documentation required in advance of meetings. Since Vista invests 
                exclusively in enterprise software, I also performed supplementary research on the 
                technology and software industry and find macroeconomic data for the Quarterly Investor Letter."

- title: Customer and Prospect Database Intern, Social Solutions Global
  from: September 2019
  to: January 2020
  description: "My work centered itself around researching high-potential markets, competitors, and existing 
                clients to help the company identify unmet needs and improve our products. I summarized these 
                findings in internal research reports for the Senior Leadership Team.

                While my job description focused on market research, I also worked with the Product and Data 
                Science teams to merge, clean, and analyze client datasets. I primarily used R when working 
                with the large datasets, but occasionally used Excel for less intensive tasks.

                In addition to the research and data components of my role, I also maintained internal 
                databases to ensure that our Sales, Product, and Marketing teams could seamlessly access any 
                relevant information."
