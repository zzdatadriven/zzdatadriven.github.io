## things to study

COUNT(ID) vs COUNT(*), when NULL exists. [link](https://learnsql.com/blog/difference-between-count-distinct/)

**Window functions.** LEAD() [link](https://learnsql.com/blog/window-function-templates/)

window function ROWS and frame_clause

    rows between 5 following and 5 preceding
    
    rows between current row and 2 preceding
    
    rows between 3 following and current row
    
    { RANGE | ROWS } BETWEEN frame_start AND frame_end

## Notes

5 questions to think before writing a query: 
    
* What tables do we need to use? 
* How do we combine different tables? 
* What fields do we need to return? 
* What conditions do we have? 
* Do we have to return a specific number of rows or in any kind of order? 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Queries for financial analysis 

1. group data by year and quarter or any other levels (Months, weeks, days) 

``` sql
SELECT  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date) AS year,
        EXTRACT(QUARTER FROM date) AS quarter,
        COUNT(amount) AS number_of_transactions
FROM card_transaction
GROUP BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date), EXTRACT(QUARTER FROM date)
ORDER BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date) ASC, EXTRACT(QUARTER FROM date);
```

2. Calculate Running Totals 

``` sql 
SELECT  DISTINCT (ct.date),
        cty.card_type_name,
        SUM (ct.amount) OVER (PARTITION BY cty.card_type_name ORDER BY ct.date ASC) AS transaction_running_total
FROM card_transaction ct 
     JOIN card_number cn ON ct.card_number_id = cn.id 
     JOIN card_type cty ON cn.card_type_id = cty.id
WHERE date > '2020-11-30' AND date <= '2020-12-31'
ORDER BY cty.card_type_name ASC;
```

3. Calculate Running Averages 

``` sql 
SELECT  ct.date,
        cty.card_type_name,
        SUM(ct.amount) AS daily_sum,
        AVG(SUM(ct.amount)) OVER (ORDER BY ct.date ASC ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS transaction_running_average
FROM card_transaction ct 
JOIN card_number cn ON ct.card_number_id = cn.id 
JOIN card_type cty ON cn.card_type_id = cty.id
WHERE ct.date > '2020-11-30' AND date <= '2020-12-31'
AND cty.card_type_name = 'visa-electron'
GROUP BY ct.date, cty.card_type_name
ORDER BY cty.card_type_name;
```

4. Time Series Analysis


``` sql 
SELECT  ct.date,
        SUM(ct.amount) AS daily_sum,
        (SUM(ct.amount)-LAG(SUM(ct.amount)) OVER (ORDER BY ct.date ASC)) 
AS daily_difference,
        co.country_name
FROM card_transaction ct 
JOIN card_number cn ON ct.card_number_id = cn.id 
JOIN customer cu ON cn.customer_id = cu.id 
JOIN country co ON cu.country_id = co.id
WHERE ct.date > '2020-11-30' AND date <= '2020-12-31'
AND co.country_name = 'China'
GROUP BY ct.date, co.country_name;
```

5. Add Multiple Grouping Levels 

``` sql
SELECT  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM ct.date) AS year,
        EXTRACT(QUARTER FROM ct.date) AS quarter,
        COUNT(ct.amount) AS number_of_transactions,
        cty.card_type_name
FROM card_transaction ct 
JOIN card_number cn ON ct.card_number_id = cn.id 
JOIN card_type cty ON cn.card_type_id = cty.id
GROUP BY ROLLUP(EXTRACT(YEAR FROM ct.date), EXTRACT(QUARTER FROM ct.date), cty.card_type_name);
``` 

6. Create a Revenue Report on a Yearly Level

``` sql 
SELECT  cu.NIN,
        cu.first_name,
        cu.last_name,
        SUM(ct.amount) AS total_revenue_per_customer,
        CASE
            WHEN SUM(ct.amount) >= 1000000 THEN 'Platinum'
            WHEN SUM(ct.amount) < 1000000 THEN 'Gold'
        END AS customer_category,
        SUM(CASE WHEN ct.date >= '2019-01-01' AND ct.date < '2020-01-01' THEN ct.amount ELSE 0 END) AS revenue_2019,
        SUM(CASE WHEN ct.date >= '2020-01-01' AND ct.date < '2021-01-01' THEN ct.amount ELSE 0 END) AS revenue_2020
FROM card_transaction ct 
JOIN card_number cn ON ct.card_number_id = cn.id 
JOIN customer cu ON cn.customer_id = cu.id
GROUP BY cu.NIN, cu.first_name, cu.last_name
ORDER BY total_revenue_per_customer DESC;
```
