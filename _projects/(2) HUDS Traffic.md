description: Harvard University Dining Services (HUDS) expressed interest in me analyzing data on the swipe counts for every day, location, and meal for the undergraduate HUDS facilities over the duration of the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 academic years. This descriptive analysis explores the changes in student dining traffic patterns following a college-wide academic schedule change.
